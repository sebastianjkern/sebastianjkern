## My Projects:

# Graphics:

- ![2D SDF Renderer: GPU](https://github.com/sebastianjkern/sdf_ui): Signed Distance Function based graphics library. GPU powered version
- ![2d SDF Renderer: Python (Discontinued)](https://github.com/sebastianjkern/sdf_renderer): Signed Distance Function based graphics library. CPU powered version
- ![Schnurrer](https://github.com/sebastianjkern/schnurrer): Automatically add moustaches to faces using pretrained facial feature recognition library.
- ![ImAscii](https://github.com/sebastianjkern/imascii): Convert images to ascii art.
- ![Pythagoras-Fractal](https://github.com/sebastianjkern/pythagoras-fractal): Plot a pythagoras theorem fractal tree

# Simulations:

- ![fluidsim](https://github.com/sebastianjkern/fluidsim): Simulate 2d fluids
- ![SpringMassClustering: Python](https://github.com/sebastianjkern/spring-clustering): Graphical clustering algorithm based on a damped spring mass system pure python version
- ![SpringMassClustering: Python+Go](https://github.com/sebastianjkern/SpringMassClustering): Graphical clustering algorithm based on a damped spring mass system, sped up version of ![this](https://github.com/sebastianjkern/spring-clustering) with main simulation code written in golang
- ![HillClimbingImageGeneration](https://github.com/sebastianjkern/hill_climbing_image_generation): Hill climbing algorithm that tries to optimize for score of an imagenet classification network. Works exceptionally awful.

# Plotting utils:

- ![ODE-Plot](https://github.com/sebastianjkern/ode-plot): Plot ordinary differential equations
- ![ET-Plot](https://github.com/sebastianjkern/et-plot): Plot points of complex functions
